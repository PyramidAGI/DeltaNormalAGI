use the behaviorblocks in the attached file to fill a python dataframe. make a pyramid structure inside the dataframe of the behaviorblocks. print two versions of such a pyramid dataframe

i want two random versions of the dataframe pyramid with the same size. there can be empty cells in the pyramid, so a sparse population

can you write the dataframes to a file and add a timestamp

can you add dummy strings with only dashes in them to preserve the pyramid shape when writing to file

the amount of dash strings is too high, decrease that with about 30%

can you add more behaviorblocks to the left side of the pyramid. multiple behaviorblocks can be in one row, but also still keep the dash strings

make the dataframe 13 columns wide. put the peak of the pyramid on column 7 and make sure that behaviorblocks are shown on the left side and on the right side. we can have multiple behaviorblocks per row, also in the sparse version
